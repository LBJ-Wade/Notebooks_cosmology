    "When working in 'high' dimensional spaces it's often difficult to visualize likelihood surfaces, look at projections of the likelihood or even store the likelihood in a useful way.  This is made more complex if you want to compute the expectation value or distribution of some complex function of your parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "A highly convenient way of handling all of these problems is a Markov Chain.  Such a chain consists of a sequence of values of your parameters (usually a file with one line of numbers for each $\\vec{\\theta}$) where the frequency in the chain is proportional to the probability of that model given the data.  With such a chain in hand many statistical problems become very straightforward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Markov Chains are generated by Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms: general methods based on drawing values of $\\theta$ from approximate distributions and then correcting those draws to better aproximate the target posterior distribution. The sampling is done sequentially, with the distribution of the sampled draws depending on the last value drawn - hence, the draws from a Markov chain. (p. 275, <i>Bayesian Data Analysis</i>, Andrew Gelman et al.; Remember that a sequence $x_1, x_2, ...$ of random events is called a Markov chain if $x_{n+1}$ depends explicitly only on $x_{n}$ and not on previous steps.)\n",

    "\"The expansion history of the universe can be determined quite easily, using as a “standard candle” any distinguishable class of astronomical objects of known intrinsic brightness that can be identified over a wide distance range. As the light from such beacons travels to Earth through an expanding universe, the cosmic expansion stretches not only the distances between galaxy clusters, but also the very wavelengths of the photons en route. By the time the light reaches us, the spectral wavelength $\\lambda$ has thus been redshifted by precisely the same incremental factor $z = \\Delta \\lambda/\\lambda$ by which the cosmos has been stretched in the time interval since the light left its source. The recorded redshift and brightness of each such object thus provide a measurement of the total integrated expansion of the universe since the time the light was emitted. A collection of such measurements, over a sufficient range of distances, would yield an entire historical record of the universe’s expansion.\" (Saul Perlmutter, http://supernova.lbl.gov/PhysicsTodayArticle.pdf).\n",

    "It's not much work to write your own MCMC code, even using the more modern algorithms.  However, the cosmology community primarily uses two packages: [CosmoMC](https://cosmologist.info/cosmomc/), which is usually integrated with CAMB, and [emcee](http://dfm.io/emcee/current/) which uses the more modern Goodman & Weare affine invariant ensemble sampler.  Personally I like the Goodman & Weare sampler because it (a) doesn't require lots of tuning of the proposal distribution and (b) allows modest amounts of parallelization (e.g. up to hundreds of \"walkers\").  It is a more modern take on MCMC theory than what's coded in CosmoMC."
